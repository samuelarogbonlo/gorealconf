# ROADMAP

This document outlines the future development plans and features for `gorealconf`. It provides a high-level view of what we aim to achieve and how contributors can help.

---
## **Short-Term Goals**
### 1. Expand Documentation
- Add detailed usage guides for each configuration source (Redis, Consul, etc.).
- Create a quickstart tutorial to help users integrate `gorealconf` into their projects.
- Add best practices for dynamic configuration management in the `docs/` directory.

### 2. Improve Examples
- Create real-world examples for:
  - Microservices using multiple configuration sources.
  - Gradual feature rollouts in high-availability systems.
  - Config validation and rollback scenarios.
- Provide inline comments and detailed explanations in example files.

### 3. Add Comprehensive Test Coverage
- Write unit tests for all critical functions, including:
  - Dynamic configuration updates.
  - Rollback mechanisms.
  - Type-safe config handling using Go generics.
- Add integration tests for:
  - Multi-source configurations (Redis, Consul, File, etc.).
  - Real-time validation under simulated load.
  - Gradual rollouts and error scenarios.
- Implement mock tests for edge cases using `testutil/mock.go`.

---

## **Mid-Term Goals**
### 1. Extend Configuration Sources
- Add support for new configuration backends:
  - AWS SSM Parameter Store.
  - Azure App Configuration.
  - Google Cloud Secret Manager.

### 2. CLI Tool
- Develop a CLI to interact with and manage `gorealconf` configurations.
  - Features: Listing configs, updating configs, and validating updates.

### 3. Observability
- Add built-in metrics export via Prometheus for:
  - Configuration change success/failure rates.
  - Rollout progression metrics.
- Implement structured logging for easier debugging.

---

## **Long-Term Goals**
### 1. Advanced Features
- Add support for custom validation plugins to allow users to define domain-specific config rules.
- Implement a configuration diff tool to compare and track changes across deployments.
- Introduce a notification system (Slack, email, etc.) for significant config changes.

### 2. Community & Ecosystem
- Establish a plugin ecosystem where developers can add custom configuration sources and rollout strategies.
- Host webinars or tutorials to onboard new users and contributors.
- Launch a website with documentation, blog posts, and use cases.
